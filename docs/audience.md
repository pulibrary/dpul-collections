## Audience

We have organized our understanding of the audiences for a Digital Collections site via their behavior, and via their relationships to the institution

Known item audiences
* Faculty with long-term/ongoing research and teaching needs
* Content partner at another institution

Known topic audiences
* Undergraduate students trying to find primary sources for end-of-term papers or Junior Papers.
* Graduate students working on end-of-term papers and dissertations.

Exploratory Search audiences
* Researchers of any age and level of education who are new to interdisciplinary research, are diversifying their primary-source appetites, or want to explore collections in a modular way: grouping things generically, thematically, geographically, linguistically (even formally, but this is very ambitious)
* Other academic professionals who come to our collections to facilitate research and teaching on their own campuses, museums, cultural institutions, etc.
* Artists
* Curious public

Audiences we want to promote to
* Alumni
* Potential donors
* Colleagues at other institutions
