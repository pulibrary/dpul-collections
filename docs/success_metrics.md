## Success Metrics

DPUL & DPUL Collections is a success if patrons are inspired to transformatively use PUL Material, whether they knew we had that material or not.

To measure that success, we have the following metrics:

1. Downloads over time (Up is better)
    * Download is a pre-requisite for many use patterns.
1. Interactions per session (Up is better)
    * Engaged browse of our material is more likely to lead to inspiration, use, further research, and knowledge creation.
1. Sessions greater than 1 minute (Up is better)
    * Engaged use of material is more likely to lead to using it.
1. Number of sources linking to our materials (Up is better)
    * Transformative use via writing and research often includes linking back to our resources, and generally sharing resources through various channels will increase the likelihood of folks using it.
1. Bounce rate (Down is better)
    * Bounce rate measures how often users land on our site and then leave without further interaction. We're hoping for users to be engaged with material on this site and find new resources - the less often they leave immediately, the more we expect that to happen.

These can be tracked at https://figgy.princeton.edu/reports/dpul_success_dashboard.

There are a couple of metrics that we think would enable us to better measure success, but we haven't found a way to implement them yet:

1. Patron representatives (likely subject librarians) report increased engagement with our materials for research and inspiration.
1. Number of books/articles that cite a PUL Digital Resource per year goes up.
