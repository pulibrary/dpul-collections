# 5. Oban for background jobs

Date: 2025-07-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have decided to cache thumbnail images used in the home, search, and item pages
to improve performance and facilitate joyful experiences. Our IIIF server
runs as an AWS lambda behind a CloudFront CDN that provides caching functionality.
Pre-caching thumbnails requires making multiple requests to this server for each
thubnail size for each image in a record. This takes a considerable amount of time,
and we don't want to further slow our main indexing processes. In addition, we would
like these image requests to retry if there are network or other issues.

## Decision

We will use [Oban](https://github.com/oban-bg/oban) to process asynchronous image caching jobs.

## Consequences

Adding Oban means we will have to periodically monitor its queues like we do
for the Sidekiq queues in our Ruby on Rails applications. On the other hand, we
now have a mechanism for offloading other asynchronous work outside of the
Broadway indexing pipeline.
